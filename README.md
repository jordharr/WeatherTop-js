# WeatherTop-js

WeatherTop-js is a web app built in Javascript using NodeJS, Express & Handlebars. This is a reimplementation of the original WeatherTop project, which was built using Java & the Play framework.
 
This app is created to display weather information for a selection of user's locations. Once registered, a user can add locations to their dashboard, which displays them on a map and alphabetically below. When the user views a "station", they can manually add a reading or auto-generate a reading using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app then does calculations to give information about the reading, along with a trend map of the last 7 days' temperature. Once 3 readings have been added to the station, it will also show a trend symbol to let the user know whether the values are rising or falling over the last 3 readings.
